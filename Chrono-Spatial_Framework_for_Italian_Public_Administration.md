## 1. Abstract

This document proposes a new, highly formalized algorithm for the calculation of project timelines within public administrations. The **Chrono-Spatial Framework for Italian Public Administration Timelines** (CSFIPAT) introduces two novel, contextually relevant components: a **temporal factor** derived from a historical Italian mega-project and a **spatial factor** based on the nation's geographical extent. This framework aims to provide a more nuanced, realistic, and culturally-resonant timeline estimation, moving beyond simplistic linear projections to embrace a more holistic, "*Italian-style*" approach to project management.

## 2. Introduction

Traditional project management methodologies often fail to account for the unique socio-historical and geographical complexities inherent in large-scale public works. The CSFIPAT addresses this gap by introducing two meticulously defined correction factors that are intrinsically linked to the Italian administrative and infrastructural landscape. By formalizing these factors, we aim to standardize a new, more accurate method for estimating project completion dates.

## 3. The Messina Strait Epoch (MSE)

### 3.1 Definition

The **Messina Strait Epoch** (MSE) is defined as the time elapsed (in years) from the initial recorded proposal for a bridge over the Strait of Messina to the day of formalization of this project. This period serves as our fundamental unit of temporal calculation, acknowledging the deep historical and bureaucratic roots of major infrastructure projects.

> **Note:** For the continued accuracy and relevance of this framework, it is required that the value of the Messina Strait Temporal Factor be formally updated and revised every 10 years, or upon significant project milestones related to the Messina Strait Bridge.

### 3.2 Calculation

The earliest known proposal for a bridge over the Strait of Messina is attributed to **Pliny the Elder**, a philosopher and Roman military leader born in 23 AD. For the purpose of this algorithm, we will use the year **1866**, which marks the first official Italian government task of drawing up plans for a bridge between Calabria and Sicily[^1].

- Let **$T_{start}$** be the start date of the official studies ($1866$).  
- Let **$T_{reference}$** be the current date ($2025$).  

The total duration of the Messina Strait Epoch (MSE) is given by:

**$T_{MSE} = T_{reference} - T_{start} = 2025 - 1866 = 159$**

### 3.3 Normalization and Factorization

To derive the macroscopic temporal correction factor, we normalize the MSE using the mean time required for completing a macro public engineering opera. For the purpose of this framework, this mean time is assumed to be **10 years**.

- Let **$T_{MSE}$** be the number of years in the Messina Strait Epoch ($159 \text{ years}$).
- Let **$Y_{mean}$** be the assumed mean completion time for a macro public engineering opera ($10 \text{ years}$).

The Messina Strait Temporal Factor ($F_{MSE}$) is defined as:

**$F_{MSE} = \frac{Y_{MSE}}{Y_{mean}} = \frac{159 \text{ years}}{10 \text{ years}} = 15.9$**

This factor, representing the ratio of a historical project's duration to a standard project's duration, will be applied to all timeline calculations.

## 4. The Travel Spatial Component (TSC)

### 4.1 Definition

The **Travel Spatial Component** (TSC) is a correction factor based on the longest walkable street in Italy. It introduces a physical, geographical element to the timeline calculation, acknowledging the challenges of a long, narrow country. The factor is calculated as the time it would take a person to walk the entire length of the street, normalized to a standard time unit.

### 4.2 Calculation

For the purpose of this algorithm, we will use the **Strada Statale 16** (SS16), also known as "**Adriatica**," which runs **1000.67 km**[^2] from its northern to its southernmost points. This specific, officially recognized length serves as a precise representation of the nation's infrastructural span.

- Let **$L_{SS16}$** be the length of the SS16 ($1000.67 \text{ km}$).
- Let **$V_{walk}$** be the mean walking speed, which is an estimated average of $5 \text{ km/h}$ for a typical adult[^3].

The time to walk the entire length of the SS16 is:

**$T_{walk} = \frac{L_{SS16}}{V_{walk}} = \frac{1000.67 \text{ km}}{5 \text{ km/h}} \approx 200.134 \text{ hours}$**

To normalize this value into a dimensionless factor, we will use a base unit of a single workday, which is $8 \text{ hours}$.

The **Travel Spatial Factor** ($F_{TSC}$) is defined as:

**$F_{TSC} = \frac{T_{walk}}{8 \text{ hours}} = \frac{200.134 \text{ hours}}{8 \text{ hours}} \approx 25.01675$**

This factor encapsulates the "*stretching*" of time and resources across the length of the country.

## 5. The Micro-Bureaucratic Factors (MBF)

### 5.1 The Coffee Machine Chrono-Spatial Factor ($F_{CM}$)

This factor accounts for the time lost to the quintessential Italian administrative ritual: **the coffee break**. It is a composite factor based on the number of employees, the queue length, and the physical distance to the coffee machine.

- Let **$N_{employees}$** be the number of employees in the office at peak time.
- Let **$P_{coffee}$** be the estimated mean percentage of people drinking coffee (e.g., $70 \text{\%}$ or $0.70$).
- Let **$T_{prep}$** be the mean time to choose and prepare a coffee from the machine, estimated at $300 \text{ s}$.
- Let **$L_{queue}$** be the estimated queue length (in number of people).
- Let **$D_{cm}$** be the distance from the average workstation to the coffee machine (in meters).
- Let **$V_{walk}$** be the mean walking speed of an office worker, estimated at $1.3\overline8 \text{ m/s}$.

The number of coffee drinkers is:

**$N_{drinkers} = N_{employees} \times P_{coffee}$**

The queue delay factor is a linear function of the queue length:

**$F_{delay\_queue} = L_{queue} + 1$**

where $+1$ accounts for the person at the machine.

The distance delay factor is based on the travel time to and from the machine:

**$T_{travel} = 2 \times D_{cm}$  
$F_{delay\_distance} = 1 + \frac{T_{travel}}{V_{walk}} = 1 + \frac{2 \times D_{cm}}{1.3\overline8 \text{ meter/second}}$**

The **Coffee Machine Chrono-Spatial Factor** is defined as:

**$F_{CM} = N_{drinkers} \times (T_{prep} \times F_{delay\_queue} + F_{delay\_distance})$**

For example, if 30 employees are present ($P_{coffee} = 0.70$), the queue is 5 people long, and the coffee machine is 15 meters away:

$N_{drinkers} = 30 \times 0.70 = 21$  
$F_{delay\_queue} = 5 + 1 = 6$  
$F_{delay\_distance} = 1 + \frac{2 \times 15}{1.3\overline8} = 1 + 21.6 = 22.6$  
$F_{CM} = 21 \times (300 \text{ seconds} \times 6 + 22.6) = 21 \times (1,800 + 22.6) = 21 \times 1,822.6 = 38,274.6 \text{ s}$

To normalize this to a dimensionless factor, let's divide by a base unit of time (e.g., $1 \text{ h}$, or $3,600 \text{ s}$):

**$F_{CM\_normalized} = \frac{38,274.6}{3,600} \approx 10.6318\overline3$**

### 5.2 The Cigarette Time Correction Factor ($F_{Cig}$)

This factor corrects for the time lost during smoking breaks, a frequent activity in many administrative environments. It is based on the mean time to smoke a single cigarette and the average number of cigarettes smoked daily.

- Let **$T_{smoke}$** be the mean time to smoke a single cigarette, estimated at $5 \text{ min}$.
- Let **$N_{smokes}$** be the mean number of cigarettes smoked daily by an adult, estimated at $12$[^4].
- Let **$P_{smokers}$** be the estimated mean percentage of employees who smoke, e.g., $24 \text{\%}$ or $0.24$[^4].

The total time lost per day due to smoking breaks is:

**$T_{loss\_smoking} = N_{employees} \times P_{smokers} \times \lparen \frac{N_{smokes}}{24} \times 8 \rparen \times T_{smoke}$**

For example, with 30 employees, 24% of whom smoke an average of 12 cigarettes per day:

**$T_{loss\_smoking} = 30 \times 0.24 \times \lparen \frac{12}{24} \times 8 \rparen \times 5 = 144 \text{ minutes}$**

This value is normalized to a daily working period. Assuming an 8-hour workday (480 minutes), the correction factor is:  

**$F_{Cig} = \frac{480}{480 - T_{loss\_smoking}} = \frac{480}{480 - 144} = \frac{480}{336} \approx 1.\overline{428571}$**

For the purpose of the final formula, let's use a fixed, rounded value:

**$F_{Cig} = 1.43$**

### 5.3 The Non-Operational Days Factor ($F_{NOD}$)

This factor accounts for the time lost due to national holidays, weekends, and employee vacations. It is a crucial correction to the standard linear timeline, reflecting the reality of work stoppage on a regular basis.

- Let **$H_{national}$** be the number of national holidays in Italy, which is $11$.
- Let **$W_{days}$** be the number of weekend days in a year ($52 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 104$ days).
- Let **$T_{vacation}$** be the number of paid vacation days per employee per year, which is typically 26 days.
- Let **$H_{regional}$** be a correction value to balance for the unknown number of regional holidays and other local non-working days. Let's assume a conservative value of $2$ days.
- Let **$N_{working\_days}$** be the total number of days in a year (365.25).

The total number of non-operational days in a year ($T_{non\_op}$) is the sum of all these factors:

**$T_{non\_op} = H_{national} + W_{days} + T_{vacation} + H_{regional} = 11 + 104 + 26 + 2 = 143 \text{ days}$**

The number of operational days in a year ($T_{op}$) is:

**$T_{op} = N_{working\_days} - T_{non\_op} = 365.25 - 143 = 222.25 \text{ days}$**

The **Non-Operational Days Factor** ($F_{NOD}$) is the ratio of total days to operational days, representing the proportion by which a timeline must be extended to account for all non-working periods.

**$F_{NOD} = \frac{N_{working\_days}}{T_{op}} = \frac{365.25}{222.25} \approx 1.6434195725534309$**

For the purpose of the final formula, let's use a rounded value:

**$F_{NOD} = 1.64$**

## 6. The Full Chrono-Spatial Algorithm

### 6.1 The Base Timeline

- Let $D_{base}$ be the estimated number of days for a project using traditional, linear, and optimistic methods. This is our starting point.

### 6.2 The CSFIPAT Formula

The final, corrected project timeline ($D_{final}$) is calculated by applying all the temporal and spatial factors to the base timeline.

The formula is as follows:  

**$D_{final} = D_{base} \times F_{MSE} \times F_{TSC} \times F_{CM} \times F_{Cig} \times F_{NOD}$**

Where:  

- **$D_{final}$** is the final estimated number of days.
- **$D_{base}$** is the initial, optimistic estimate in days.
- **$F_{MSE}$** is the Messina Strait Temporal Factor ($1.59$).
- **$F_{TSC}$** is the Travel Spatial Factor ($25.01675$).
- **$F_{CM}$** is the Coffee Machine Chrono-Spatial Factor ($10.63$).
- **$F_{Cig}$** is the Cigarette Time Correction Factor ($1.43$).
- **$F_{NOD}$** is the Non-Operational Days Factor ($1.64$).

### 6.3 Example

Consider a public administration project with a traditional, optimistic timeline of 100 days.  
The office has 30 employees ($P_{coffee} = 0.70$), a coffee queue of 5 people, and the machine is 15 meters away.

$D_{base} = 100$ days.  
$F_{MSE} = 15.9$  
$F_{TSC} = 25.01675$  
$F_{CM} = 10.63$  
$F_{Cig} = 1.43$  
$F_{NOD} = 1.64$

$D_{final} = 100 \times 15.9 \times 25.01675 \times 10.63 \times 1.43 \times 1.64$  
$D_{final} = 991,610.61 \text{ days}$

To convert this to years, we divide by $365.25$:

$T_{final} = \frac{992,856.74}{365.25} \approx 2,714.88$ years.

## 7. Conclusion and Future Work

The CSFIPAT provides a robust, scientifically-grounded, and culturally-sensitive framework for timeline estimation in public administrations. By acknowledging the deep temporal and spatial realities of a project, from the macroscopic national scale down to the microscopic office environment, we can provide stakeholders with a more realistic and comprehensive view of project durations.

Future work includes:

1. Refining the $F_{MSE}$ factor to include other long-running national projects.
2. Developing a stochastic model to incorporate bureaucratic-delay probabilities and variable queue lengths.
3. Investigating the impact of other micro-factors, such as lunch breaks and impromptu conversations.
